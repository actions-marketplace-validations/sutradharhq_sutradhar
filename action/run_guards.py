"""Run Sutradhar's guards for the GitHub Action (`action.yml` at the root).

`action.yml` is a composite action with one step: it hands every input to
this script through an environment variable and runs it with the runner's
`python3`. Nothing here goes through a shell. An input is never pasted into
a `run:` body - that is the Actions injection hole, and doctrine 2.8's shape
in YAML - and every guard is started as an argument list, so a value cannot
become a command whatever it holds. A value that looks like a shell
metacharacter or a flag where a path belongs is still refused, because it is
far more likely a mistake than a path, and a mistake read as a path scans
the wrong tree and says OK.

What runs by default, with no configuration:

    swallow            swallow_lint.py over PATHS          (2.7)
    interpolation      interpolation_lint.py over PATHS    (2.8)
    conflated-degrade  conflated_degrade_lint.py over PATHS (2.7)
    ci-step            ci_step_lint.py over WORKFLOWS      (6.3, 6.7)

Opt in by naming them in `guards`: `budget` (needs a design-notes directory
and a tests directory, 1.1) and `rounds` (needs round records, 8.1).
`framework_only` and `framework_shape` are refused by name: they gate a
promise only the Sutradhar repository makes, and in an adopter's tree they
can only ever pass (R20-4). A gate that cannot fail is decoration (3.7).

Every guard exits 0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 could not run. Read here as:

    0                  pass
    1                  finding - fails the job
    2                  could not run - fails the job unless
                       on-cannot-run is `skip`, and is never silent
    70, or anything else:
                       crashed - fails the job whatever on-cannot-run says.
                       A crash is the instrument's failure, not a verdict
                       about the code (6.8, 6.11), and it is named as such.

A crash is decided by the exit code alone, never by reading the output. A
guard's output quotes the pull request under test - an f-string expression,
a filename - on stdout and on stderr alike, so any text test over it is a
verdict the pull request can forge: a file named `Traceback (most recent
call last).py` used to turn a finding into "crashed - the guard failed, not
your code" (R24-1). Each guard is therefore started under a launcher this
script owns (`_LAUNCH`), which runs it exactly as `python3 guard.py` would
and turns an exception that escapes the guard - including a guard file that
cannot be read - into exit 70, a code no guard uses. Every adopter-derived
string written to the step summary is escaped to inert text (`md_inert`).

`on-cannot-run` defaults to `fail`, because a job that goes green when a
guard read nothing is the R21-2 lie (an OK over zero files) told one level
up. `skip` exists for a tree where a guard deliberately has nothing to read;
each skip still prints the guard's own sentence, raises a warning annotation
and a row in the step summary, and a run in which every selected guard was
skipped fails anyway - nothing was checked, and that is not a pass (2.9).

Usage (the action sets these; locally you can too):

    SUTRADHAR_PATHS=src python3 action/run_guards.py
    python3 action/run_guards.py --selfcheck

Exit 0 every guard that ran passed, 1 a finding or a crashed guard, 2 the
run could not be made: an input refused, or a guard could not run under
`on-cannot-run: fail`, or nothing at all was checked.
