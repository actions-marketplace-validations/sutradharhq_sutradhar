"""The example must keep demonstrating, or it is worse than not shipping it.

A walkthrough that has quietly stopped catching its planted defects is
exactly the decoration this framework exists to name - and it fails in the
most damaging place, in front of someone evaluating whether any of this
works. So the demo runs in CI like any other guard.

Verified by mutation before being written down: fixing the silent swallow,
making the decorative test real, or enforcing the orphan budget each turns
the runner red (6 of 7, exit 1).
