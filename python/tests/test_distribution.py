"""The two one-line adoption paths: `action.yml` and `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`.

Both are files a stranger's tooling reads from a clone of this repository,
so their failures land in someone else's CI and never in ours. What can be
pinned offline is pinned here; the GitHub half (the action actually running
on a runner) is the `action` job in .github/workflows/selftest.yml.

No YAML library: the repository ships stdlib only. The action's `run:`
bodies are read with ci_step_lint's own scanner - the reader this repo
already trusts for workflows - and the rest with line patterns over files
whose shape this repository controls. Each test's docstring names the
mutation that was shown to turn it red.
