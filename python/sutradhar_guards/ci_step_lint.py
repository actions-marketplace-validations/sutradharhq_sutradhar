"""Guard: every CI step that runs a script must be able to find it, and no
step may pipe its exit code away.

This is doctrine 6.7 - *an exit code is not a witness* - applied to CI
wiring. A step whose interpreter exits 2 on file-not-found has made a claim
about a process and none at all about the code it was pointed at, and it
takes every later step in that job down with it. Red, read as "the guard is
failing", when it means "the guard is absent".

*Scar: a CI step ran a guard by a path that did not resolve under that job's
working directory. The interpreter exited 2 on file-not-found, which is a
claim about a process and not about the code under test, and it took every
later step in the job down with it. The guard had never once run, and its red
was read for weeks as "the guard is failing" rather than "the guard is
absent". A neighbouring step survived on the author's attention rather than
on a rule.*

The invariant
-------------
For every ``run:`` step, resolve each ``*.py`` path it names against that
step's effective working directory - the step's own ``working-directory``,
else the job's ``defaults.run.working-directory``, else the repository root.
The file must exist.

This checks REACHABILITY, not correctness: a script that exists can still be
wrong, but one that cannot be found cannot be either. It is the same class as
R16-1, the plugin that resolved `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../python` and so
worked in exactly one layout - the one it was built in. Nothing inside that
layout can see it.

What is deliberately NOT flagged, because a guard that cries wolf is muted:

  * **absolute paths** (``/tmp/target/scripts/x.py``). They do not resolve
    against a working directory at all, and they are usually a file an
    earlier step in the same job created. The count of skipped ones is
    printed rather than hidden - an exclusion the operator cannot see is the
    same class of lie 6.7 is about.
  * **a bare ``foo.py``** with no directory separator, which is ambiguous.
  * anything not ending in ``.py``.

The second invariant: a pipe must not swallow an exit code (6.3)
------------------------------------------------------------------
A ``run:`` step's status is its shell's status, and without ``pipefail`` a
pipeline's status is its LAST command's. ``pytest | tail -5`` exits with
tail's 0 whatever pytest said, so a failed build reads as success. GitHub
runs a step with no ``shell:`` key as ``bash -e {0}`` - ``-e`` without
``pipefail`` - so the default is the swallowing one.

*Scar (6.3): ``| tail`` reported a failed production build as success during
a drill. No guard checked a workflow for it; the rule was convention-only
(R22-3).*

A pipe is flagged unless one of these holds, each checked, none guessed:

  * ``set -o pipefail`` (or a ``set -...o pipefail`` cluster) runs earlier
    in the same step;
  * the effective shell - the step's ``shell:``, else the job's
    ``defaults.run.shell``, else the workflow's - is plain ``bash`` (which
    GitHub expands to ``bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}``) or names
    ``pipefail`` itself;
  * every command upstream of the last ``|`` is ``echo`` or ``printf``,
    which have no build status to lose (``echo x | tee -a "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"``
    is a report, not a swallowed check).

``||`` is not a pipe, and ``|`` inside quotes, ``${{ }}`` expressions, or a
comment is not read as one. Only POSIX shells (bash, sh, zsh) are read for
pipes at all. pwsh, powershell and cmd have a different exit-code model and
the remedy printed here (``set -o pipefail``) is a bash command that breaks
them; ``python`` or a custom interpreter reads ``|`` as an operator. A step
with no ``shell:`` anywhere, in a job whose ``runs-on`` names windows, runs
under pwsh by GitHub's default and is skipped (R23-10). A ``runs-on`` that
is an expression (``${{ matrix.os }}``) names nothing and is read as bash.

Do not point this at a workflow TEMPLATE. ``ci/guards.yml`` in this
repository names ``scripts/swallow_lint.py``, which resolves in the tree
``bootstrap.sh`` builds and not in this one; running the guard over a
template reports the template's whole point as a finding.

Usage:
    python ci_step_lint.py .                 # -> <repo>/.github/workflows
    python ci_step_lint.py .github/workflows
    python ci_step_lint.py path/to/one.yml
    python ci_step_lint.py --selfcheck

Exit 0 reachable and no swallowing pipe, 1 a step cannot find its script or
pipes away its exit code, 2 the check could not run
(no argument, an unknown flag, a directory with no workflows in it). 2 is not
a pass: "could not measure" and "did not fail" are different answers (2.9).

The YAML is read with a hand-rolled indentation scan and no third-party
parser, so the guard runs in any environment a workflow itself would.
