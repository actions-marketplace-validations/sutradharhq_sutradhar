"""Guard: flag exception handlers that silently swallow errors.

A "silent swallow" is an ``except`` handler that catches broadly
(``except:``, ``except Exception``, ``except BaseException``) and whose body
neither logs, nor re-raises, nor calls an explicit degrade function - yet
returns an empty value (``None``, ``[]``, ``{}``, ``""``, ``0``, ``False``)
or consists only of ``pass`` / ``continue``.

Why this matters: a swallowed exception converts an outage into a lie. The
incident that earned this guard: a fleet-wide datastore failure was
swallowed into ``{}``, which downstream code read as "an event-free fleet",
flipping a detector's verdict for every entity at once - under a green
status, cached for the full TTL.

This is a RATCHET, not a big bang. A per-file baseline records today's
swallow counts; the gate fails only when a file EXCEEDS its baseline (a new
silent swallow) or a non-baselined file introduces one. The baseline can
only shrink: fix a swallow, rerun ``--update-baseline``, and the floor
drops. You can adopt this on a codebase with hundreds of existing swallows
on day one and still never regress.

Usage:
    python swallow_lint.py src/                     # gate against baseline
    python swallow_lint.py src/ --update-baseline   # record today's floor
    python swallow_lint.py --selfcheck              # prove the detector works

Exit 0 no swallow beyond the baseline, 1 a new swallow, 2 the check could
not run: an unknown flag, or paths that hold no Python file at all. 2 is not
a pass. A scan that read nothing used to print ``OK (0 files ...)`` and exit
0, so a CI step pointed at a directory with no Python in it - most often the
template's ``src/`` in a tree that keeps its code somewhere else - reported
green on every run and had checked nothing (R21-2). That is the lie this
guard exists to catch, told by the guard about itself.

The detector is AST-based: it sees bare ``except:``, tuple handlers that
include Exception, and bodies of any length. Intentional swallows (there
are legitimate ones: "metrics must never break the request") stay in the
baseline with a comment at the site explaining why.
