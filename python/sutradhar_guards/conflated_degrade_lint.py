"""Guard: a failed read must not be spelled the same as an empty one.

Doctrine 2.4 says a failure states itself, and 2.7 says an ``except`` block
logs, degrades explicitly, or re-raises. ``swallow_lint.py`` catches the LOUD
half of that - a handler that logs nothing. This catches the quiet half it
structurally cannot see: a handler that DOES log, and returns the same value
some legitimate "there is nothing here" path in the same function returns.
The log line exists, the caller still cannot tell the two apart, and every
number computed downstream is computed over an unknown fraction of reality
under a green status.

*Scar: three instances in one private build thread, all found by hand and
none by a guard. A read that hit a corrupt key returned the same "no
baseline" value as a read that found nothing, so a partial corruption still
reported success while the affected records silently dropped a boundary
interval. An absent timestamp and an unreadable one both collapsed to an idle
state, and idle raises no alert. A failed lookup fail-safed to `{}`, which is
indistinguishable from "nothing to report", so one dependency blip made a
fleet-wide verdict read clean.*

WHAT IS FLAGGED: a function whose ``except`` handler returns a falsy literal
(``None`` / ``{}`` / ``[]`` / ``0`` / ``False`` / ``""``) that some
NON-exception path in the same function also returns.

**The fix is not "raise instead."** The fail-safe value is usually right -
that is why it was chosen. The silence is the defect. Make the two
distinguishable: return a ``(value, ok)`` pair, set a counter the caller
reads, or carry a status/reason it must look at. A guard that pushed every
one of these into a raise would be traded for an outage, and then removed.

RATCHET: a baseline of today's conflations, which may only shrink. A NEW
conflation fails the gate; a banked entry that has since been separated also
fails, with "bank it" - the floor drops monotonically and a silently-fixed
entry cannot linger as a hole nothing re-checks. A conflation that is real
and intended - two paths that genuinely mean the same thing to every caller,
such as "this was a notification, there is no reply" - stays in the baseline
with a comment at the site saying why, exactly as ``swallow_lint`` handles
the swallows a project means.

THE KEY is ``path::qualified_name`` and never a line number. The qualified
name carries the enclosing class for a method (``Cls.method``) and the
enclosing function for a nested def (``outer.inner``); a later same-named
sibling in one file gets ``#2``, ``#3`` in source order, so adding a second
``read`` never changes the first one's key. A baseline keyed on a position
re-flags what it already banked the first time anybody edits above it, and
the only quick way out is ``--update-baseline``, which banks the real new
findings too (R18-1, and see ``ratchet.py`` for the contract).

Usage:
    python conflated_degrade_lint.py src/                    # gate
    python conflated_degrade_lint.py src/ --update-baseline  # record the floor
    python conflated_degrade_lint.py --selfcheck             # prove it works

Exit 0 at or below the floor, 1 a new conflation or an unbanked fix, 2 the
check could not run: an unknown flag, no path, a duplicate key, or paths
that hold no Python file at all. 2 is not a pass. Named paths that held
nothing used to print ``OK (0 file(s) ...)`` and exit 0, which refused the
default directory nobody named and then accepted a named one nobody could
read (R21-2).

The ratchet is implemented here rather than imported from ``ratchet.py`` for
the same reason ``swallow_lint.py`` does it: these files are copy-in and land
in different directories in an adopter's tree, so a cross-module import would
break for them and not for us.
